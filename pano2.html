        <h1>Caroline Ide Cluett’s Falling off her Chair Story:</h1>         
        <p>In 1904, Albert E. Cluett married my Grandmother, Caroline R. Ide of Troy. They had four sons: John, Edmund, Albert and Richard. The family moved into 59 Second Street in September of 1910 after being transferred the house from Albert’s Aunt and Uncle, Amanda and George Cluett, after the  tragic passing of their son, Alfonzo, to typhoid fever.</p>
        <p>Grandmother Caroline was a very well-respected lady and was actively involved in the Troy community. She was one of the founders of the Women’s Exchange, was closely connected to the Samaritan hospital, and was a lifelong member of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church where she was an active member of its women’s organizations. That’s why it’s such a pleasure to remember her more humorous moments.</p>
        <p>One night, we were having supper in the dining room. The whole family was around the table eating their second course.</p>
        <p>Grandmother had been using her buzzer under the table to alert the cooks to bring in each new course.</p>
        <p>However, this time, she had scooted her chair back a bit too far. Grandmother Caroline was a petite woman and as much as she stretched her leg, she still struggled to touch the buzzer with her foot. As she reached for the buzzer she began to sink lower and lower on her seat until...she slid right out from her chair and onto the floor.</p>
        <p>Everyone in the room started laughing as she set off the buzzer with her bottom. The cooks came in not because of the buzzer sound but because of the raucous laughter emanating from the room.</p>
        <p>*This is based on a true story but specific details are not guaranteed to be accurate.</p>
