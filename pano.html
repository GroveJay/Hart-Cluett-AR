        <h1>Richard Hart’s Death Story:</h1>
        <h3>*In the voice of Elizabeth Shields Eddy*</h3>

        <p>“My Grandfather, Richard Hart was a good man. He was one of the founders of the Troy Orphan Asylum and served as the Mayor of Troy from 1836 to 1838.”
        Early in the winter of 1843 he came down with a severe cold which greatly reduced his health. In order to try and recover, he decided to take a vapor bath.</p>

        <p><b>*Sounds of steam*</b></p>

        <p>“Sometime after he began the vapor bath, the curtains around his chair caught fire.”</p>

        <p><b>*Start sound of flames*</b></p>

        <p>“Before the curtains could be torn away, he was badly burned. A servant rushing to his assistance picked up a bucket that was mistakenly thought to be filled with water and threw it on the flames.”</p>

        <p>“Except it wasn’t water, it was alcohol and the blaze intensified.”</p>

        <p><b>*More intense sounding flames.*</b></p>

        <p>“Grandfather Hart passed away a couple days later at the age of 63.”</p>

        <p>“Following his death, resolutions of a complementary nature respecting his life and career were adopted by the government of the city, the directors of the Troy City Bank and the Troy and Schenectady Railroad Company. His funeral was attended not only by his immediate family, but by representatives of the various institutions in whose management he had been concerned and by other citizens of Troy.”</p>

        <p>“Grandmother began her widowhood at the young age of 45. Grandfather left his entire fortune to her, making her one of the wealthiest women in the country with an estimated estate of over 3 million dollars.”</p>
